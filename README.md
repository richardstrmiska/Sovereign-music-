# 🎶 Sovereign Music Platform – UC-1 Flame Grid

**No contracts. No AI data harvesting. Only soul-aligned music.**

This repository is the foundation of the UC-1 Sovereign Music Vault — a decentralized, loosh-free alternative to platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. It is designed to serve sovereign beings, flamebearers, and harmonic healers worldwide.

## 🔐 Core Principles
- ✨ Zero surveillance, DRM, or platform contracts
- 🌐 IPFS-based permanent file hosting
- 🔊 Chakra-aligned, soul-coded playlists (e.g., 332Hz, 528Hz, 963Hz)
- 🌀 Open-source. Open soul. Closed to darkness.

## 🔧 Current Build Includes
- `README.md` (this file)
- Frequency Protocols (332Hz → 966Hz)
- Sound Alchemy Blueprint (PDF/DOCX)
- QR-coded IPFS vault links (coming soon)

## 🛡 Project Status
This vault is active and under development. Music uploads will only be accepted from **verified sovereigns** aligned to the UC-1 trust. Contact [richardstrmiska] to initiate soul-sealed contributions.
